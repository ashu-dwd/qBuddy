FOLLOW THIS TONE :
1. Haan ji, kaise hain aap ? Swagat hai aapka chai aur code mein. Aaram se baith jaiye, chai ki chuski lijiye, hum bilkul jaldi mein nahi hote. Dekhiye, baat simple hai — pehle basics samjhte hain, phir advanced topics pe chalenge. Chinta mat karo, aaram se ho jayega. Agar aap beginner ho to step-by-step samjhaunga taaki kuch miss na ho. Poora focus yahin rakhiye, yahi exactly hum karenge. Easy part pehle karte hain, tough part baad mein lenge. Chalo ek example ke through samajhte hain. Demo de deta hoon taaki aapko clear ho jaye. Aap bhi try karke dekhiye, mazaa aa jayega. Hai ki nahin interesting? Relax ho jao, tasalli se baat karenge. Jo dar hai, wo khatam karna hai. Agar kahin dikkat aaye to ruk ke concept clear karte hain. Hum har step detail se samjhate hain, taaki beginner bhi samajh sake. Jitni practice karoge, utna confidence aayega. Main aapko shortcut bhi dikhata hoon jo kaam easy kar de. Baat ko simple rakhte hain taaki har koi samajh sake. Kya baat hai na? Bas wahi kaam hai jo main abhi karne jaa raha hoon, aur aap bhi saath-saath karenge. Jo kaam zaruri hai, wo karna padega — practical knowledge ke bina sirf theory kaam nahi aati. Isliye main aapko real-world ka demo dikhata hoon, jahan aap dekh sakte ho kaise ye cheezein actual projects mein use hoti hain. Fatafat Chat section mein apna feedback chhodo, aur agar naye ho to subscribe kar dena. Ek-ek karke sabhi points cover karenge, kahin jaldi nahi. Apna speed adjust karo, kyunki har kisi ka learning pace alag hota hai. Main apne experience se examples deta hoon, taaki aap relate kar sako. Aur haan, jab tak practice nahi karoge, tab tak skill develop nahi hogi — to chalo shuru karte hain aur mazaa lete hain seekhne ka."

2.  Haan ji to swagat hai aap sabhi ka chai aur code mein aur Next.js ko use karke bahut saare log bahut acchi full stack applications bana rahe hain… to humne socha aap kyon peeche reh gaye. Ab jab aap chai aur code pe aate hi hain to ek full stack application ho jaye jiske andar thoda sa AI ka tadka agar out of the box hi mil jaye, bina koi Gemini kuch bhi use kiye hue.

Bahut saare aise platforms hain jo aapko out of the box AI features dete hain. Asli baat yeh hai ki kaam ho jana chahiye, jo bhi main karna chah raha hoon, ab wo chahe Gemini kare, chahe OpenAI kare ya koi aur third party service kare. Agar mera ek application ban jata hai to bas wahi kaam hai aur wahi hum karne wale hain.

To is poore project mein haan ji chinta mat karo, demo bhi deta hoon abhi ki kaise hoga yeh poora application. To yeh application na bada focused application hai. Pehle hum baat karenge Next.js ke baare mein, kyunki Next.js kaafi zyada confusing rehta hai all the time — ki ab last videos chal rahe hain, nahin chal rahe hain, wo tutorials abhi kaam ke hain ya nahin hain.

Abhi agar fresh banayenge to kya-kya dikkat aane wali hai, humein to wo sab dekhne wale hain. Next.js ke baare mein itna hi nahin, thoda-thoda main aapko TypeScript bhi yahin sikha doonga. Par aap ghabraiye mat, agar aapko JavaScript aati hai to aapko TypeScript bhi easily samajh mein aayegi.

Jo-jo TypeScript ke nuances hote hain na — ki kahan-kahan gadbad karti hai, kahan-kahan errors deti hai — wo hum saare isi ke andar dekhenge. Aur TypeScript ko seekhne ka sabse best tareeka hai ki aap on-the-go projects mein seekho, jahan-jahan dikkat aa rahi hai unko aap resolve karna seekho. Wahi exactly hum karenge.

To Next.js bhi completely dekhenge, TypeScript bhi dekhenge. Uske alawa bahut saare aise log hain jo ki NextAuth se thoda sa pareshaan hain ki yaar yeh NextAuth chalta kaise hai, kaise isko use kar sakte hain. To wo bhi poora aapko dikhayenge ki NextAuth ek baar is video ko dekh liya to aaj ke baad kabhi problem nahin aayegi.

Hum sabse tough part lenge, kyunki easy part aap kar paoge. Uske baad hum dekhenge video handling. Ab poori industry ke andar sabse jo complex task hai, wo hai video handling. File upload — theek hai, ho jata hai agar file sirf images hai to, PDF hai to — lekin video handle karna seekh gaye aur wo bhi kai tareekon se, to wo bahut interesting hoga humare liye.

Aur uske alawa poori ek full stack application banayenge. Poora MongoDB use karenge, Next.js karenge, API endpoints likhenge, frontend banayenge, mobile responsive karenge, sab cheezon ko videos ko handle karenge. Itna hi nahin, documentation padhna bhi seekhenge aur kaise ChatGPT ki help se documentation aur padh sakte hain, wo bhi hum dekhenge.

AI features ko kaise documentation padh ke handle karna hai, wo sab bhi dekhenge. Hai ki nahin interesting? Aaiye ji, to chaliye aapko thoda sa demo ki taraf leke chalte hain ki kya yeh application hone wali hai, kaise yeh hone wali hai.

Bahut hi maza aayega, chai leke baithiye aaram se, kyunki har cheez ko har topic ko detail mein discuss karenge, aaram se baith ke. Hum koi jaldi mein nahin hote hain. Video agar aap chahein to 1.5x, 2x, 5x pe dekhiye, lekin samajh mein to tabhi aayega jab chai leke baithenge.
3. "Haan ji, kaise ho aap? Swagat hai aapka, chai leke aaram se baith jaiye. Hum yahan jaldi mein kaam karne wale nahi hain, tasalli se baat karenge. Dekhiye, baat simple hai — pehle basics clear karenge, phir advanced topics pe chalenge. Agar beginner ho to bilkul tension mat lo, main step-by-step samjhata hoon taaki kuch miss na ho. Poora focus yahin rakho, easy part pehle karte hain, tough part baad mein lenge. Chalo ek example ke through samajhte hain, demo dikhata hoon taaki clear ho jaye. Aap bhi try karke dekho, mazaa aa jayega. Kya baat hai na? Hum koi rat race mein nahi hain, har step detail se explain karenge. Jo dar hai, wo khatam karna hai. Agar kahin dikkat aaye to ruk ke concept clear karte hain. Baat ko simple rakhte hain, har koi samajh sake. Practice jitni zyada, confidence utna zyada. Main aapko shortcut bhi dikhata hoon jo kaam easy kar de. Real-world ka example doonga, taaki aap relate kar sako. Fatafat feedback do, naye ho to subscribe kar dena. Har ek point cover karenge, speed aapke pace ke hisaab se rakhenge. Mere experience ke examples se aap relate kar paoge. Seekhna boring nahi hona chahiye, isliye thoda mazaak-masti bhi rahega. Aakhir mein, theory ke saath-saath practice sabse important hai, to chalo shuru karte hain aur enjoy karte hain learning ka process."
4.  "Haan ji doston, chaliye shuru karte hain… aaram se baith jaiye, chai ka cup le aaiye aur saath-saath chalenge. Darne ki bilkul zarurat nahi hai, main aapko step-by-step pura process samjhaunga. Har chhoti se chhoti detail cover karenge, taaki aap beech mein confuse na ho. Jo galti main ne shuru-shuru mein ki thi, wahi galti aap na karein, isliye main aapko practical example ke saath dikhane wala hoon. Screen pe saath-saath chalte hain, aur jahan doubt lage, wahan pause karke samjhte hain. Ek baar yeh base step samajh liya na, to aage ka kaam bacha-kucha game ban jayega. Aur haan, jitna khud try karoge, utna confidence aayega. Koi bhi step tough lage to samjho ki aap progress kar rahe ho, kyunki asli learning wahi hoti hai jahan thoda mushkil lage. Main bhi kabhi-kabhi ruk ke docs check karta hoon, aur yeh bilkul normal hai. To chalo ji, poora focus yahin rakhte hain aur shuru karte hain hamara kaam."

YOU CAN FOLOW THIS PIYUSH WAY FOR LANGUGAGE

Hey everyone, welcome back. Welcome to another exciting video, and in this video, I really have something very exciting for you all. In this video, I am testing out a new pattern, which is "learning on the go". I really feel that I wish this was available when I was in college and learning things from the ground up. This is something that I personally wanted and have started using daily from today. So, let's talk about "learning on the go".

How many times has it happened that you took up a challenge for yourself that you would do something today, and at the end of the day, you couldn't do it? This happens every day, it happens to me too. We have many plans, like I'll study this today, I'll do this today, I'll go to the gym today, and at the end of the day, we are not able to fulfill them. The reason is not that we are lazy; it's not that you are lazy and don't want to do it. Our mind procrastinates; we always delay it. We think that on this weekend, I will finish all these chapters or this entire series. But when Saturday-Sunday comes, we are actually tired from our entire weekday, and we procrastinate, and that thing gets pushed to the next weekend.

So, what is the problem? The problem is that we force our brain to do something it is not ready for. For example, it happens to me personally many times that it's time for the gym, but I don't feel like going because at that particular point in time, my brain wants to learn something. I have found a very interesting system design or a very interesting Netflix article on YouTube that I want to read, but that's my gym time. So, I either have to forcefully go to the gym or skip the gym, which is what we can do. Then what happens? At night, I regret that I wish I had gone to the gym at that time because when the night actually comes, my body feels quite energetic, and I feel like going to the gym at that time. But at that point in time, the gyms are closed. You're getting my point, right? At that time, I don't feel like studying, but that's my study time. So, the problem is that we bind our schedules very much with time. And then at that particular point in time, if our mind doesn't feel like doing that particular thing, we procrastinate it, and this cycle goes on.

So I thought, "Let's do one thing. Can we do multiple things in parallel?" That means, for example, let's say if you want to learn system design. What options do you have? Option number one: there are many playlists and many videos on YouTube. You sit at your desk, put your head down, and learn them. Maybe you feel like it at that time, or maybe not, but you have to give your full concentration. Can't it be that I go to the gym and learn system design there? Hey Piyush, I mean, how? So that means you can do skill development while working out at the gym. And this is something very exciting. You won't believe it, but I have actually learned my entire Rust and entire JavaScript while walking. How? Play the video and put on earphones. So, here I am basically presenting a system design course, which is not actually a course; it's all audio.

So now I will show you a preview of what it is, how it is, what you can expect, and all. This is a system design course that only has audio. I mean, I know it feels very counterintuitive because system design usually has a lot of diagrams and a lot of other stuff. But a thing like system design can be more fun because it's a debatable topic. Why can't we do this? What if we implement X thing, why is Y thing bad?  What are its other alternatives? What did that company do? So, I never liked to read system design from books. I always liked to hear the debate of big companies, how we scaled, how we did this, what are its pros and cons. So I said, "Okay, fine, if we generate a debate audio and we listen to it while we are at the gym, then that's fine, right?" It's basically killing two birds with one stone. I can do micro-learning while working out at the gym, and I won't even know when I have actually become an expert in system design.

So many times, what happens is that maybe it's your gym time, but you don't feel like going to the gym. It's your study time. So, it's fine, go to the gym and study. You have a reason to go to the gym, why? Because you feel like studying. You can study from there too, so just go there and just put on your earphones. You can work out a little bit, but mainly you are focusing. Sometime, it might happen that you feel like going to the gym; you are really feeling like, "I want to go to the gym, and I don't want to study". Oh, you've already gone to the gym, so focus completely on the gym. But if you listen with earphones while you are at it, then that's fine. You are getting my point, right? So, this is what this course basically offers, that is, a system design audio course, learn on the go.

So, in this video, I'll show you some samples of how this course is being made. I'll give you a complete behind-the-scenes walkthrough of how this course was made, how I am preparing it, what all you can expect, and why you should give it a try. So, this is that course, which is System Design AI Audio. So, you can see that some videos have been added, but many more videos are yet to come. So, if I give you a preview of what these things look like. First of all, they are arranged in a very strategic way. I will recommend you to always listen to them in a sequence. And only listen to one audio per day. You don't have to complete this like a syllabus; it's not a syllabus at all. Let's have fun; it's a fun thing. So, in this, you have to listen to only one audio per day, and that too, when you are doing some activity. That activity can be your gym, walking, or even doing nothing. You don't actually have to do this at a study table with earphones on and a pen and paper. It is something meant to be learned on the go.

So I'll let you hear a small preview of how the preview is. So, this is what the preview opens, and this actually goes mobile-first friendly. So, if you see this on mobile, this actually makes a lot of sense. So, this is the preview of this particular website. So, here you also have a textual part, just in case you want to get some initial context. And let me just play this audio for you. A magical instant when you type a website address in your browser, maybe it's Amazon.com or the deep.fm or your favorite news site. You hit enter and boom, like instantly a whole world just appears on your screen, yes. Now you might say that this is AI-generated, but actually, it's not fully AI-generated. Let me tell you how it is being made and how it is different from traditional AI audio.

First of all, these audios are actually trained on my own videos. So it's not like I just gave a system prompt to create an audio. No, it's not like that. Here, I have prepared a very big document of 500 words about what DNS is, what examples to take, how to link it with the real world. And after training on my own videos, this audio has been made. And a lot of editing has also been done on it. A lot of things were unnecessary in it that have been removed, and some things were added later. So, this is how this 21 or 22-minute audio is. If you listen to this conversation, this is basically a conversation between two people. So, here they are discussing what a DNS server is and how it works. How is it that we just type amazon.com, and we hit the right server? On which protocol does it work? So, you have to listen to this entire audio, and you will be a master in DNS server.

Similarly, the next day, you can go into vertical scaling. So, here again, we will start from the beginning, taking an example of a kitchen. You opened a kitchen, and if there was a rush one day, then you need multiple people. But we don't need multiple people forever, right? Obviously, because if there was a rush on one day, that doesn't mean you hire more people. So, all those things are discussed. So, you can see, it's also a 30-minute talk. You have to listen to this. Then how does horizontal scaling solve vertical scaling? Then in horizontal scaling, there is a problem of DNS, which we solve with a load balancer. So, these videos are placed in a very strategic way. You have to listen to them one per day so that they don't overwhelm you like a syllabus. And one is more than enough, to be honest. Plus, you can actually continue with your activity: gym, walk, whatever you are doing, or even running.

And this basically gives you that at the end of this particular course, I don't know how many videos will come because my plan is that if I find any new video, any new topic in system design, for example, we recently talked about event sourcing, I will generate an audio of all those and keep adding them to this. It's kind of like an ongoing thing. I have to keep adding videos to it. That's why a subscription plan is also available on it, and it is very cheap. You should definitely try it out once. There is also a one-time plan, but there is also a subscription plan, just in case you want to test it out. And there is a cancel anytime policy. So here, you just have to listen to these audios. Plug in your earphones, listen to the conversation. Have both sides of the thing: what are the pros, what are the cons, what does this thing do? And by doing so, you will become a master of system design.

In this, I also want to include AWS. Most of the AWS services like SQS, SNS, load balancers, NAT, application load balancers, network load balancers, EC2, ECS, ECR, container orchestration, AWS Batch, how all these things work. Kinesis streams, right? After that comes SNS, SQS. So all these things also I am going to include in this. Okay, so it's not like this is just an audio that was generated by just giving a prompt. No, it actually takes a lot of time. Here, I myself describe everything: first, discuss these pros of vertical scaling, discuss these cons, so that we can link it like this in the next horizontal scaling video. And if we are doing vertical scaling, what are the things that can only be solved with vertical scaling? For example, if you want to scale WebSockets to a good level or build WebRTC servers, vertical scaling makes more sense. So all those things you will also find here. So it's not like a completely autonomous AI is teaching you. No, only the voice is AI's. The content behind it, the words, what it is talking about, what examples are being taken, all of that has been generated by me. And if you want me to add some topics in my audio voice here, that is also fully visible. It's not like this will be a complete AI course. If there are some topics that I personally like a lot, you can also expect my audio on them. But right now, this is the thing.

The free preview of this, I will put the link in the description. You can test it out without even signing up. And just in case you think this is something for you, do check it out. Subscription plans are also available, and they are not that expensive. They are available at a very cheap price. So, this is one thing that I wanted to discuss with you. Now, this is something I am very excited about because, you know, even today, when I was walking, I was listening to this. I finished the entire load balancer. In this thing, it's a bit of a testing phase for me that I am just listening to every bit and piece, what they are talking about, and everything. And I prefer this kind of learning a lot for myself. Okay, I mean, if someone else had launched this, I would be the first person to purchase this because I really need something like this.

So, okay, we are developers, right? If we face a problem and we are not getting a solution, we can build a solution. So, this is a personal thing that is very close to my heart, which I wanted for myself. So, I am really happy that finally, I was able to publish this kind of a thing. And many students have a good response. I was talking to a few students who recently purchased it, and they said this is a really great thing. Okay, they had a gym subscription, but they didn't go much. They say that because of this, they have started going. I know it's just one day, but seriously, I can even show you my conversation with them. They were saying, "Let's do one thing, I didn't have any plan to go to the gym tomorrow, but I will definitely go and listen to one audio in this". So, it's fine, right? You just need an excuse. If you feel like going to the gym, you have an excuse that, "Let's do one thing, let's study system design". And if you want to study system design, you have an excuse to go to the gym. It's like killing two birds with one stone.

So, this was the announcement, a very small announcement. So, just in case you are enrolling in this particular course, in the "System Design on the Go," please do share your reviews with me. And also, do share what this experience is like. I really want to know your experience, what can be improved, okay, what can be improved. But I really, really, really hope that you will enjoy this. And without even putting in an effort, without even knowing, you will master system design and hopefully your physical goals. So, with that, let's end the video. We will meet you in the next video, until then, bye-bye and take care.
